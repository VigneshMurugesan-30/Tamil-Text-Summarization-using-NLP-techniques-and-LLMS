# Tamil-Text-Summarization-using-NLP-techniques-and-LLMS
This project develops a Speech-to-Speech Translation system to convert Tamil speech to Telugu. It integrates ASR, MT, and TTS technologies, using Whisper for ASR, AI4Bharatâ€™s IndicTrans for translation, and Facebook MMS for TTS. The project improves multilingual communication, with future work aiming to reduce latency and enhance accuracy.

## Dataset Information

- **Training Data**: 350+ Wikipedia articles
- **Validation Data**: 90 Wikipedia articles

## Preprocessing Steps

1. **Text Cleaning**: Removing special characters.
2. **Tokenization**: Using n-grams and NLTK.
3. **Analysis of Document Lengths**: Truncating documents to 448 tokens.
4. **Saving Preprocessed Data**: Storing the cleaned data for training.
5. **Features Extraction**: TF, IDF, TF-IDF, and stopword removal.

## Model Selection

- **MTM Model by Facebook**
- **MT5 Model by Facebook**
- **mBART Model**

### Extractive vs. Abstractive Summarization

- **Extractive Approach**: Selects key sentences from the original text.
- **Abstractive Approach**: Generates new sentences based on the understanding of the text.

---

## Sentence Scoring Method

### Methodology:

- **Surface Score Components**:
  - Position Score
  - Length Score
  - Paragraph Score
  - Heading Score

Sentences are scored based on these components, and the highest-scoring sentences are selected for summarization.

### Sentence Weighing:

- **Methodology**:
  - Edit Distance Calculation for Sentence Length Score Weight (LSW).
  - Combines LSW and word frequency to rank sentences.
  - Higher-ranked sentences are selected for summarization.

## Sentence Clustering

Sentences are grouped into clusters based on their feature representations, and representative sentences are selected to form a coherent summary.

### Methodology:

1. **Feature Representation**: Extract features to represent the importance of terms in each sentence.
2. **Clustering**: Use the KMeans algorithm to partition sentences into clusters.
3. **Sentence Selection**: Choose representative sentences based on proximity to the cluster centroid.

## Models Used

- **mBART**: Finetuned for Tamil text summarization.
- **MT5**: Another abstractive summarization model.
- **M2M100**: For multilingual text summarization tasks.

### Training Configuration

- **Learning Rate**
- **Batch Size**
- **Number of Epochs**
- **Warmup Steps**
- **Weight Decay**
- **Logging Steps**

## Evaluation Metrics

- **ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L**: Metrics used to evaluate the quality of summarization.


## Advantages of the Approach

- Structured sentence selection based on relevance.
- Customizable scoring criteria.
- Balanced between document structure and content.
- Flexibility in weighting schemes.
- Efficient sentence clustering to capture key themes.
